# Homework-PWA

++++ABOUT++++
The goal of this homework was to get a better feel for progressive web apps. First, I ran an audit to see how the website performed. Then added some packages to reduce the size of the javascript files (used the compression npm package). Then used webpack to bundle up the db.js and the index.js files in the dist folder.
